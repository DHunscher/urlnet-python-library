## Mining the Web for Social Networking Data ##
When studying aspects of the World Wide Web using network analysis tools and techniques, building networks for analysis can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone.  The UrlNet library, written in the Python scripting language, is intended to provide a powerful, flexible, easy to use, "spider"-like mechanism for generating such networks.

UrlNet was originally written with to aid in the analysis of search engine result set quality. This relied on the time-tested method of harvesting links from static or dynamically generated Web pages. Many of its features stem from the demands of this research domain, but have much wider applicability.

## A Tool for the Semantic Web ##
UrlNet's usefulness is not limited to spidering and link harvesting. Because many data sources focused on a plethora of subjects are also available via Web Services over the Internet, UrlNet can be employed to build networks for many different topic domains.  For example, it has been used to look at blogger conversations and biomedical researcher co-citation networks.
